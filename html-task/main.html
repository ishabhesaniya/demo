                <h1>Shopping</h1>
                <p>Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers,[1] that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.[2]
        
                    Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry[3] as consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices, or wherever they want. The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to have it delivered relatively quickly. Using online shopping methods, consumers do not need to consume energy by physically visiting physical stores. This way they save time and the cost of traveling. A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods.
                    
                    Shoppers' shopping experiences may vary. They are based on a variety of factors including how the customer is treated, convenience, the type of goods being purchased, and mood.[4]

            <h1>Shopping for pleasure</h1>
            <p>The modern phenomenon of shopping for pleasure is closely linked to the emergence of a 
                middle class in the 17th and 18th-century Europe. As standards of living improved in the 17th 
                century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in 
                excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or bourgeosie stimulated demand for luxury 
                goods and began to purchase a wider range of luxury goods and imported goods, including: 
                Indian cotton and calico; silk, tea and porcelain from China, spices from India and South-East 
                Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.[17] The act of shopping came to be seen 
                as a pleasurable pass-time or form of entertainment.[2]
                By the 17th-century, produce markets gradually gave way to shops and shopping centres; 
                which changed the consumer's shopping experience.[18] The New Exchange, opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the 
                Strand was one such example of a planned shopping centre. Shops started to become important as places for 
                Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. Restoration London 
                also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects 
                like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield.

                <h1>Abstract</h1>
                <p> 
                How has the retail end of the fashion industry changed? 
                During the Renaissance, fabrics were bought from markets and pedlars,<br> 
                as they had been for centuries. Textiles were relatively expensive. In the early 1800s small 
                specialist shops continued to be important but larger establishments began to emerge, able to group together 
                a wider range of goods. Herein was born a new era of shopping.<br> These developments not only changed the ways in 
                which people could buy fabrics and clothing; they shaped ideas about how to behave and dress. This resulted in 
                an explosion in consumerism and fashion that continues today.<br>
                Glazing was widely used from the early 18th century. English commentators pointed to the speed at which glazing was installed. Daniel Defoe, writing in 1726, noted, "Never was there such painting and guildings, such sashings and looking-glasses as the shopkeepers as there is now."[7] <br>
                One of the first Londoners to experiment with this new glazing in a retail context was the tailor Francis Place at his Charing Cross establishment.[8]

                        A single instance of Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source can support multiple sites, stores, or 
                        store views that use different attributes and content. A typical scenario is to set up stores with different <br>
                        options in different domains. For example, you might want one set of categories and products on one domain and 
                        another set of categories and products on a different domain in another language.<br> 
                        Merchants can configure the websites, stores, and store views in the Admin.
                        When the hierarchy is defined, you can apply configuration settings according to scope so that each site, store, and store view provides the product catalog and storefront experience you want.

                    Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to 
                    directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser.<br> 
                    Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by 
                    searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same 
                    product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop 
                    online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, 
                    tablet computers, smartphones, and smart speakers
